===================================
=== REQUIREMENTS

* A 64-bit machine (ideally with AES-NI support)
* SCons (v2.3.2)
* OpenSSL (0.9.8zg)

If you want to get cache hit statistics:
* PAPI library (v5.4)


===================================
=== INSTALLATION

Once you have installed OpenSSL and SCons, compilation should be pretty easy.

To compile the code, run:
$ scons

To run the test suite, execute:
$ build/btest/btest -v

To print debug messages while compiling:
$ scons VERBOSE=1

To compile with profiling, run:
$ scons WITH_GPROF=1

To clean up the object and binary files, run:
$ scons -c

To compile the library as PIC, one can run:
$ env CFLAGS="-fPIC" scons

To generate a shared library, one can add this line to the
end of libballoon/SConscript:
  env.SharedLibrary("balloon-dyn", src)

We have tested the code on a few platforms, but this is no guarantee that the
code will compile correctly for you.

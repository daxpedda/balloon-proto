This is a research protoype of the Balloon space-hard hash function.  The code
is still a work in progress. Some (not all) of the parts of the code that need
attention are marked with TODO comments. See the LICENSE file for licensing
information.

Please DO NOT use this code in production!

This is an early research prototype built exclusively for benchmarking purposes
and it is almost certainly riddled with obvious security vulnerabilities. In
the future, if this code gets the level of scrutiny that security-critical
production code deserves, I will remove this warning. Until then, here be
dragons.
